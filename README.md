# IoEclipse
The repository for any code pertaining to my work in researching the atmospheric collapse of Jupiter's Io in Eclipse

This is a combination of spectrum reduction and manipulation files which serve to analyze data taken at APO ARCES 3.5m telescope of Io during its eclipse in Jupiter's shadow.
